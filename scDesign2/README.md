# scDesign2 Python clone

This is a Python clone of the scRNA-seq simulator [scDesign2](https://github.com/JSB-UCLA/scDesign2). All parameter names are the same as in the original implementation.

In the `main.ipynb` one can find part of Part 1 and Part 2 of the official tutorial (https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/JSB-UCLA/scDesign2/blob/master/vignettes/scDesign2.html).


### Datasets
The B Cells datasets used can be downloaded from [here] (https://cellxgene.cziscience.com/collections/4195ab4c-20bd-4cd3-8b3d-65601277e731). The B cells datasret is called [scRNA-seq data - B cells] (https://cellxgene.cziscience.com/e/396a9124-fb20-4822-bf9c-e93fdf7c999a.cxg/).
For the mouse dataset follow the official [tutorial] (https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/JSB-UCLA/scDesign2/blob/master/vignettes/scDesign2.html), and export the count matrix to a csv.
